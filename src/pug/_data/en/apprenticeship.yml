      title: third-year apprentice
      surname: Wiebke
      description: The apprenticeship projects at HolzFormArt offer us the opportunity to work autonomously and solve any problems that may occur on our own. Be it a dining table or a piece of solid wood furniture that we’ve designed ourselves – experienced journeymen are always at the ready to help us with questions or problems. So every project is initially a challenge and at the end it has become a huge step forward on my career path.

      title: third-year journeyman
      surname: Lars
      description: 'Since completing my apprenticeship at HolzFormArt, I have been working towards my qualification as a master joiner and was very quickly entrusted with a lot of responsibility. I am now assembly supervisor, doing exactly what I am best at: I head large projects all over Europe and bring them to a successful conclusion, but at the same time I am still busy in the workshop and involved in the production process. At HolzFormArt, I have every opportunity to shape my career path in keeping with my own ideas.'

      title: third-year apprentice
      surname: Vincent
      description: As an apprentice at HolzFormArt, your development is really nurtured. I was even able to work in a joinery in Ethiopia for a month in the second year of my apprenticeship. That was a truly valuable time for me. I learnt so much from the people there and was able to transfer this experience to my day-to-day work here in Germany.
