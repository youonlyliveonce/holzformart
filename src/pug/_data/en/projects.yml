      copy:
        - 'The challenge of the project we were commissioned with by our client Skagen didn’t just lie in its unique location at the heart of the fashion world. The requirement was also to make the concept adaptable to all their stores and shop-in-shop spaces throughout Europe.'
        - 'Working closely with the American designers, we developed and implemented a sophisticated, scalable shop concept that presented the brand identity of the Danish fashion label in a tangible form. Simplicity and elegance in the choice of the materials glass, metal and wood were underlined by a subtle lighting concept. Excellent quality married with practicality – a reflection of the brand.'

      copy:
        - 'Baselworld is an international trade show for quality watches and jewellery. In collaboration with the brand custodians of the Adidas company, we developed the concept for the showroom of the sport article manufacturer in an exclusive environment. The key concept was to stage their range of quality-crafted chronograph watches using an unusual contrast in materials.'
        - 'The result was an excellently crafted product presentation stage on which glass and metal conveyed the technical perfection of the sports watches. The cool materials were offset by the natural appeal of rough wooden surfaces. As an expression of durability and sports performance – and thus of the identity of the Adidas brand.'

The kitchen, too, bears our signature in its concept, lighting, modern styling and colours, and the integration of the worktops made of cold-rolled stainless steel.'
        - 'The styling emerges from the function of the objects, the lines are clear, and the design is reduced to the minimum: to the function. And to expressing the style, aspirations and individuality of the residents.'

      copy:
        - 'In this period, we have already developed over 40 shops for them throughout Europe, fitting them out in the unmistakable interior style of the brand. The home-living ambience of the shop, which picks up the popular belgian country-house style and transfers it to the shop spaces, is characterised by individual custom-made fabrications. They give each shop its own character.'
        - 'The situation was similar for their presence at a trade show in Shanghai – a particular challenge for us and the designers of the brand, which we resolved with numerous specially made individual fabrications and a great deal of craftsmanship.'

      copy:
        - 'A feast for the eyes, so the saying goes. This isn’t just limited to arranging food on a plate, as is proven by the great deal of attention that restaurateurs give to the styling of their premises. The atmosphere plays a crucial role in the culinary experience. The designer Dena Rawle is intimately acquainted with the nuances of this field and designed the food court for the Palais Vest in Recklinghausen. The challenge for design and production was creating the differently themed spaces within the food area.'
        - 'The solution was to employ characteristic materials in each area. Ranging from limed oak and weathered wooden surfaces to concrete and rusted steel – along with 16 orange trees.'

The team had a free hand in developing it themselves and produced it entirely out of solid oak – including the sink. The wood has been oiled, revealing its natural surface with its characteristic feel, which is highlighted through the subtle, built-in lighting.'
        - 'The inspiration for the design came from our joinery: a pile of wood was the model for the concept, picking up the everyday life of our employees and providing them a quality space to spend time.'

      copy:
        - 'Dazzling colours, unconventional design and character – the concept store for the popular accessories brand Georg Gina & Lucy, located in the Pasing Arcades, had to match the products of the label. We were able to gain the services of artist and designer Delphine Buhro for the appropriate styling of the interior. She staged the shop as a brightly coloured, family home-life world with a wooden façade, various metal structures and contoured glass panes.'
        - 'The variety of the range and design is expressed in the materiality and tactility of the partially imprinted wooden surfaces. The particular challenge of the project, however, was something entirely different: reconciling the expectations of our client and the ideas of the artist with the fire safety regulations of the shopping mall.'

        - 'Our client wanted a light, bright living space, with a modern atmosphere complemented by echoes of country-house style to provide an exciting contrast. Our solution was to remove a wall to create larger, brighter rooms in which contemporary colours and styling could be combined with features of the country-house style. And behind this “façade” lies state-of-the-art technology and LED lighting.'
